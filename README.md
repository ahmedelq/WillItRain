# Will It Rain tomorrow? 
## About 
This project goal is to predict whether it will rain on a certain day given some measurable variables (n=23) such as evaporation and windspeed.
Since we have a time-series data,  LSTM model will be utilized. The data is outsourced from Kaggle ([Rain in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). 

## Data Description
I'm expecting to deal with 23 features, some will be dropped, some have missing values that needs to be cleaned and also standardized. 
also some features are categorical that needs to be encoded approperiatly, the prediction will be whether it will rain or not.

## Tools
- Pytorch
- Pandas
- numpy
